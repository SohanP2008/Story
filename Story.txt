There was once a young boy, John, who was always curious about how technology functioned. He researched about this for hours on end until one day, he figured out about programming. "But what is programming," he thought. He started to ask around, going from person to person as he did not want to give up on his new discovery. After a few days of asking people he figured that no one was able to help him. The next day was his birthday, and on that day, little did he know that he was about to be surprised. His father had gotten him admission to WhiteHatJr, a popular programming tuition. John couldn't have been more happier than he was at that moment. The End.
